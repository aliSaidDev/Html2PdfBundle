Html2PdfBundle
==============

This bundle makes it very easy (and fun) to generate PDF files in your Symfony2 project.
This bundle is based on the version 4.03 of the HTML2PDF library (http://html2pdf.fr/en) which
uses the version 5.0.002 of the library TCPDF (http://www.tcpdf.org/)


The Bundle is heavy but it already contains HTML2PDF and TCPDF libraries which are heavy.
If you can install whatever you want on your server, we suggest you use the KnpSnappyBundle
(https://github.com/KnpLabs/KnpSnappyBundle) which is light and nice, but it requires the
wkhtmltopdf library to be installed on your server.
